<th>A variant identified in the U.K</th>
<td>This COVID-19 variant (B.1.1.7) has 23 mutations. Several of these mutations are<br>
in the spikelike S protein that the virus uses to attach itself to the surface of human<br>
cells. This variant might be associated with an increased risk of death compared to other<br>
variants, but further research is needed.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<th>A variant identified in South Africa</th>
<td>This variant (B.1.351) has multiple mutations in the S protein. There's no evidence that<br>
this variant cause more severe disease due to COVID-19.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<th>A variant identified in Brazil</th>
<td>This variant (P.1) has 17 mutations, including 3 in the S protein. Some evidence suggests<br>
that this variant might be less vulnerable to antibodies generated by a previous COVID-19<br>
infection or a COVID-19 vaccine.</td>
