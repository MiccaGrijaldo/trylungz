There are numerous solutions and preventions to the spread of the Corona Virus.
First, wear a mask and face shield when traveling outdoors, especially in crowded
areas. Wearing one will cover your mouth and nose where the virus penetrates your
body. Second, maintaining good hygiene. Examples are washing your hands with clean
soap and water, utilizing 70% Isopropyl Alchohol frequently, and covering your face
with a tissue or with your elbow when sneezing and coughing (NOT WITH BARE HANDS).
Lastly, is to take good care of our body. Our body is our responsibility. Sustaining
a healthy diet and vitamin intake helps make our body immune to viruses.
