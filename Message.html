<td align="center">This pandemic has been hard for many of us. Being departed and even losing<br>
our loved ones can be disheartening. This message of hope is for the people<br>
that were greatly affected by the virus. This trial that we are facing right<br> 
now serves as a sole purpose for us to become stronger and to heal ourselves.<br>
I am proud of everyone who is fighting to save and protect us. May God be with<br> 
you all. Revelation 21:4 â€œHe will wipe away every tear from their eyes, and<br> 
death shall be no more, neither shall there be mourning, nor crying, nor pain<br>
anymore, for the former things have passed away.</td>

<td align="center">Where there is life there is hope, always stay focused, there is a better<br>
future ahead. No matter how many times you fall, you must always be determined<br>
to succeed. Rise up and try again and again. You must not lose hope. Always be<br>
positive in life, there is a season for everything on earth.</td>

<td align="center">Our current situation is hard. Everyone is struggling to live. Everyone is<br>
suffering. Everyone is scared. But how can we lift each other up if all of us<br>
are thinking of the negative results? We should always think positively.<br>
Everything happens for a reason. We have passed all the challenges that we<br>
have experience and I also believe that we will also be able to pass all the<br>
challenges that will come our way. We just need to trust him. Let's trust his<br>
way of making us a better person. Let's never stop hoping. Padayon!</td>
