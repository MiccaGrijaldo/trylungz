The Covid-19 is a disease that widely spread in just a little amount of time. 
In just a year, it already took millions of lives and turned our world upside down. 
But how does this disease spread? Covid-19 is a disease that can be transmitted. If 
you will be in contact with a person who has this disease, it can be easily transmitted 
into you. The virus is transmitted by droplets such as saliva and tears. They are also 
studying if the said virus is an airborne or not. The virus spread widely as there are a 
lot of people who does not follow the health protocols. As the people get closer to each 
other, the bigger the chances that there is a virus transmitter among the group that can 
be transmitted to the people around that person, with that being said, the virus fastly 
spreads.
